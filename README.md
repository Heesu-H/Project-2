# Project-2 Living in Victoria Living Safe

## Background
We endeavoured to make an interactive visualisation of crime in each area of Victoria to assist in deciding the safest areas to live in.
* Victoria has some of the fastest growing Local Government Area (LGA) populations in Australia.
* More than 4 Million people call Victoria home.
* Victoria population grows around 20,000 to 150,000 people each year.
We strongly believe this app will assist people moving or living in Victoria to find a safe place to live.

## Web design:

I have a suggested workflow, if you guys would like to try this? 

Please integrate any working code for the website (including javascript app.js and flask app.py etc.) to the directory "01_main." For now, feel free to work in other folders if you are more comfortable, to simply run tests in isolation, and when you have something working, merge your code into the 01_main folder. 

Alternatively, you could follow the "conventional" git workflow and make a separate branch, test your code directly in the 01_main folder in your separate branch, then if it works well, merge it into the main branch. 

When we have finished all tasks, we can cut all files from 01_main and paste them into the root directory and delete all temp folders. (i.e. 00_temp, 01_main, heesus_temp_file, LGA_geomap, suburb geomap)
