# Project-2

## Internal Note:

I have a suggested workflow, if you guys would like to try this? 

Please integrate any working code for the website (including javascript app.js and flask app.py etc.) to the directory "01_main." For now, feel free to work in other folders if you are more comfortable, to simply run tests in isolation, and when you have something working, merge your code into the 01_main folder. 

Alternatively, you could follow the "conventional" git workflow and make a separate branch, test your code directly in the 01_main folder in your separate branch, then if it works well, merge it into the main branch. 

When we have finished all tasks, we can cut all files from 01_main and paste them into the root directory and delete all temp folders. (i.e. 00_temp, 01_main, heesus_temp_file, LGA_geomap, suburb geomap)
